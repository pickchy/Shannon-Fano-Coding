This code represents the execution of the Shannon-Fano algorithm for character encoding.
To work, you need to run the file display.py .
The probabilities for the alphabet characters will be stored in files p1 and p2, and the alphabet file will contain the alphabet itself.
all actions are saved to a file with the appropriate name.
The program also allows you to check the Craft inequality, find redundancy and the average length of the codeword.

here's how this algorithm works:
